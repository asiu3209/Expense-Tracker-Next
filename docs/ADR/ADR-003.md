# ADR-003: Using Next.js Instead of Vite for Project Development

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context

I need to decide which framework or build tool to use for developing this web application. The main contenders are **Next.js** and **Vite + React**.

**Requirements:**

- Support for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)
- Built-in routing and optimized performance
- Easy deployment and scalability
- Active community and long-term maintainability

**Options considered:**

1. **Vite + React:** Fast local development with a simple setup, great for SPAs but limited built-in SSR and routing support.
2. **Next.js:** Full-featured React framework that provides SSR, API routes, image optimization, and seamless deployment options.

## Decision

I will be using **Next.js** for this project instead of Vite.

**Rationale:**

- **Built-in routing system** eliminates the need for external routing libraries.
- **Server-side rendering and static generation** improve performance and SEO.
- **API routes** enable backend logic without setting up a separate server.
- **Optimized deployment** through Vercel or other cloud providers.
- Strong community support and continuous feature updates.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Enhanced performance and SEO through SSR and SSG
- Simplified file-based routing and deployment
- Unified environment for both frontend and backend logic
- Easier scaling and maintainability

**Negative:**

- Slightly steeper learning curve compared to Vite
- More configuration overhead for smaller projects
- Some loss in hot-reload speed compared to Vite’s dev server

**Mitigation:**

- Create clear documentation for routing and SSR usage
- Use Next.js’ hybrid rendering approach to optimize performance and development time
